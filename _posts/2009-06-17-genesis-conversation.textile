And now for something completely different...

While poking around YouTube I stumbled across a funny take on what it might be like if Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins were to have a conversation about their band Genesis; a band they were both in and lead singers at different times.  I'm a big fan, all the way back to their progressive rock albums of the 70s.  I've observed that most of my generation (I'm 33) doesn't realize Peter Gabriel used to be the lead singer and Phil Collins was the drummer.  Gabriel left in '76 and Collins took over his role after a lengthy and fruitless search for a replacement.

Anyway, those of you who'll get the in-jokes should find this hilarious.  I've transcribed it below as well, as the cockney accents are rather thick, with references to some of the jokes.  Note: I couldn't embed this video here as embedding is disabled; shame:

PG: Yeah?  You did a crap album, and quite a good album, and you just sold out completely.
PC: Ah, well, we weren't gonna cash in were we, doing "Prog Rock":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prog_rock? It wudn't going anywhere.
PG: Nah, I don't know, you could've moved into new formats, you know; brought in the Africans?
PC: Yeah, you've obviously done that, haven't ya?
PG: "WOMAD!":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Womad  It worked out quite well for me.
PC: Well, I'm not denying that. But, ya know, you got the credibility with all the critics and that.
PG: [???] Calm down, calm down, Look at me now, I'm cryin'!
PC: Yeah!
PG: Shock the monkey, shock the monkey!
PG: You can't drum!

PC: I remember.
PG: "I Don't Remember":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel_(1980_album)#Track_listing, I don't recall, I have no memory, of anything at all.  Actually...
PC: I remember the days when we were in a band together.  And I used to drum, I used to sing.
PG: You weren't there at the start, my friend.
PC: Aiight. No I wasn't, but I was there... a bit.
PG: Cheerio, good work on some of those albums, though.
PC: Yeah. Cheers, cheers.
PC: Do you like Duke?
PC & PG: Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke!

fn1. From "Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_zeppelin#Post-Led_Zeppelin_.281981.E2.80.932007.29: On 13 July 1985, Page, Plant and Jones reunited for the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing a short set featuring drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins and bassist Paul Martinez. Collins had contributed to Plant's first two solo albums while Martinez was a member of Plant's current solo band. However, the performance was marred by the lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune Les Paul and poorly-functioning monitors, and by Plant's hoarse voice. Page himself has described the performance as "pretty shambolic", while Plant was even less charitable, characterising it as an "atrocity". When Live Aid footage was released on a four-DVD set in late 2004 to raise money for Sudan, the group unanimously agreed not to allow footage from their performance to be used, asserting that it was not up to their standard.

fn2. Actually, Phil Collins wrote songs for Tarzan, not Lion King.
